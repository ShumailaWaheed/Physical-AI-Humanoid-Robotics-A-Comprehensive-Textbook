title: ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's designed to be distributed and modular, allowing different components of a robotics system to communicate seamlessly.

## Key Concepts

### Nodes

A **Node** is an executable process in ROS 2 that performs a specific task. For example, one node might be responsible for reading data from a sensor, another for processing that data, and a third for controlling a motor. Nodes are designed to be modular and reusable.

- **Modularity:** Each node typically handles a single, well-defined task, making the system easier to develop, debug, and maintain.
- **Isolation:** Nodes run as separate processes, providing fault isolation (if one node crashes, it doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system).

### Topics

**Topics** are the primary mechanism for asynchronous, one-way data streaming in ROS 2. Nodes publish messages to topics, and other nodes subscribe to those topics to receive the messages.

- **Publisher:** A node that sends data to a topic.
- **Subscriber:** A node that receives data from a topic.
- **Messages:** Data exchanged over topics are structured using predefined message types. These types ensure that both publishers and subscribers understand the format of the data.

**Example:**
- A camera node might publish image messages to a topic named `/camera/image`.
- An image processing node might subscribe to `/camera/image` to receive images for analysis.

## How Nodes and Topics Interact

Nodes communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages over topics. This publish/subscribe model allows for a flexible and decoupled system:

1.  **Publisher Node:** Creates messages of a specific type and publishes them to a named topic.
2.  **ROS 2 Middleware (DDS):** The underlying Data Distribution Service (DDS) handles the efficient transfer of messages from publishers to subscribers.
3.  **Subscriber Node:** Expresses interest in a particular topic and receives all messages published to that topic.

This architecture enables complex robotic systems to be built from many smaller, independent components that collaborate by exchanging information.

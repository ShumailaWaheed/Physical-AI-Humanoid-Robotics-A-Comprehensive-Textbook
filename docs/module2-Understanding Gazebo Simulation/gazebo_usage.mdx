# Using Gazebo

Once Gazebo is installed and set up, you can use it to simulate robot behavior and test complex scenarios. This file explains how to create robots, interact with simulations, and run tests efficiently.

## Creating Robots

Gazebo supports multiple ways to add robots:

- Use prebuilt robot models from the Gazebo model database.
- Import URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files for custom robots.
- Position the robots within the simulation world.

## Interacting with Simulations

You can interact with the simulation in real-time:

- Apply forces or velocities to robots.
- Use keyboard or controller inputs to move robots manually.
- Observe sensors and camera data in the simulation environment.

## Running Tests

Gazebo enables robust testing of robotic systems:

- Perform physics-based experiments to verify stability and movement.
- Test robot software in a safe environment without hardware risk.
- Use automated scripts to simulate repetitive tasks or scenarios.

Gazebo’s capabilities allow robotics developers to test, visualize, and improve their systems efficiently. By following these steps, learners can gain practical experience with robot simulation and prepare for real-world deployment.

# Setting Up Gazebo
sidebar_position: 3

Gazebo is a powerful robotics simulator that allows developers to test and visualize robots in a virtual environment. Setting up Gazebo properly is the first step to creating effective simulations. This file explains the installation process, basic simulation creation, and environment configuration.

## Installation

Installing Gazebo is straightforward. Follow these steps:

- Ensure your system meets the requirements: Linux is recommended, but Windows and macOS are also supported.
- Install Gazebo via package manager or download from the official website.
- Verify the installation by running `gazebo --version` in the terminal.

## Creating Basic Simulations

After installation, you can start building your first simulation:

- Launch Gazebo and select a world template or create a new one.
- Add simple models like boxes, spheres, and robots from the Gazebo model library.
- Position objects and define their properties such as size, mass, and friction.

## Configuring the Environment

Customizing your simulation environment is essential:

- Adjust lighting, camera angles, and physics properties.
- Use plugins to enhance functionality, such as controlling robot movement.
- Save your world configuration for future use.

Gazebo setup allows you to experiment safely with robotics systems before deploying them in real-world scenarios. Following these steps ensures a stable and functional simulation environment for learning and testing.

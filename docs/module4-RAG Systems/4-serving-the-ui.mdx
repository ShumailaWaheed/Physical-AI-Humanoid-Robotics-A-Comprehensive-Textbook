# Module 4.4: Serving the UI with React and MDX

Once our RAG pipeline is functional—able to retrieve relevant documents and generate answers—we need a user interface (UI) to interact with it. A web-based UI is a common choice, and frameworks like React are perfect for building dynamic, responsive frontends.

MDX, the format these documents are written in, is particularly powerful because it allows us to embed and execute React components directly within Markdown content.

## Displaying Markdown Content in React

A key feature of a RAG UI is the ability to display retrieved content, which is often in Markdown format. To render Markdown correctly in a React application, we can use a component that wraps a library like `react-markdown`.

Below is an example of how you might use such a component.

```jsx
// Example usage within your application:
const retrievedMarkdown = `
# Safety Protocol XR-5

This document outlines the safety protocol for the **XR-5 robotic arm**.

- **Emergency Stop:** The emergency stop button is located on the main control panel.
- **Operating Speed:** Do not exceed 80% of maximum speed in training mode.
- **Maintenance:** Weekly diagnostic checks are mandatory.
`;

<MarkdownRenderer markdownContent={retrievedMarkdown} />
```

### Live Example

Here is the `MarkdownRenderer` component in action, rendering a sample document that our RAG system might have retrieved. This demonstrates how we can present source material to the user for verification.

<div style={{marginTop: '20px'}}>
  <MarkdownRenderer markdownContent={`
# Safety Protocol XR-5

This document outlines the safety protocol for the **XR-5 robotic arm**.

- **Emergency Stop:** The emergency stop button is located on the main control panel.
- **Operating Speed:** Do not exceed 80% of maximum speed in training mode.
- **Maintenance:** Weekly diagnostic checks are mandatory.
`} />
</div>


## Building a Complete RAG UI

A complete UI for a RAG system would typically include:

1.  **A Search Bar:** An input field where the user can type their query.
2.  **A Results Display Area:** A section to show the final, generated answer from the LLM.
3.  **A Source/Citation Display:** A component, like our `MarkdownRenderer`, that shows the original source text retrieved by the RAG pipeline. This is crucial for transparency and allows the user to verify the LLM's answer against the source material.
4.  **Loading and Error States:** Visual feedback to inform the user when the system is processing a query or if an error has occurred.
5.  **Filtering Options:** UI elements (like dropdowns or checkboxes) that allow users to filter the search by metadata fields (e.g., file type, creation date).

This module provides the conceptual building blocks for a RAG system. By combining the data ingestion and embedding logic from the previous sections with a user-facing application built in React, you can create a powerful, end-to-end AI system capable of reasoning about your private knowledge base.

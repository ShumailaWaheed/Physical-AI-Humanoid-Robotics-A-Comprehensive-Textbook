# Course Overview & Learning Goals

## Navigating Your Journey into Embodied AI

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics for Capstone Quarter"! This book is designed to be your comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. Throughout these modules, you will build a foundational understanding of the software, simulation, and AI tools necessary to embark on your own Physical AI projects, particularly within the exciting domain of humanoid robotics.

### Book Structure at a Glance

The book is organized into an **Introduction** and **four distinct Modules**, each focusing on a critical aspect of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. Within each module, you will find several chapters that delve into specific topics, accompanied by practical exercises, code snippets, and conceptual diagrams.

Our journey is structured as follows:

*   **Introduction (Chapters 1-3)**: You are here! This section provides the foundational definitions of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, setting the stage for the technical deep-dive that follows.
*   **Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Explores the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the de facto standard framework for robotics software development. You will learn how robots communicate, process data, and execute commands.
*   **Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Introduces powerful simulation environments. You will learn to create virtual replicas of robots and their surroundings, enabling safe and efficient development and testing.
*   **Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Dives into advanced AI capabilities for robotics, leveraging NVIDIA's Isaac platform. This module covers perception, navigation, and decision-making for intelligent robots.
*   **Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA) + Capstone**: Focuses on the cutting edge of human-robot interaction, exploring how robots can understand natural language and execute complex tasks. The module culminates in guidance for your capstone project.

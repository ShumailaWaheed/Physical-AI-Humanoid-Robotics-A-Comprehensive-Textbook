## Clarification Summary

I have asked 2 questions and integrated the answers into the specification.

- **Updated Spec:** `specs/001-physical-ai-book/spec.md`
- **Sections Touched:** `Clarifications`, `Edge Cases`, `Functional Requirements`, `Success Criteria`

### Coverage Summary

| Domain & Data Model | Clear | Key entities are outlined. |
| Interaction & UX Flow | Clear | Primary user journeys are covered. |
| Non-Functional Quality Attributes| Resolved | Generation time is now specified. |
| Integration & External Dependencies | Clear | Tech stack is implicitly defined. |
